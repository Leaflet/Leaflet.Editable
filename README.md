# Leaflet.Editable

Make geometries editable in Leaflet.


This is not a plug and play UI, and will not be. This is a minimal, lightweight,
and fully extendable API to control editing of geometries. So you can easily
build your own UI with your own needs and choices.

See the [demo UI](http://Leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.Editable/example/index.html), an more [examples below](#examples).
This is also the drawing engine behind [uMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap).


Design keys:

- only the core needs
- no UI, instead hooks everywhere needed
- everything programmatically controllable
- MultiPolygon/MultiPolyline support
- Polygons' holes support
- touch support
- tests

## Install

You need Leaflet >= 1.0.0, and then include `src/Leaflet.Editable.js`.

### Path dragging

If you want path dragging, you need to also include [Path.Drag.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Path.Drag.js).


## Quick start

Allow Leaflet.Editable in the map options:

    var map = L.map('map', {editable: true});

Then, to start editing an existing feature, call the `enableEdit` method on it:

    var polyline = L.polyline([[43.1, 1.2], [43.2, 1.3],[43.3, 1.2]]).addTo(map);
    polyline.enableEdit();

If you want to draw a new line:

    map.editTools.startPolyline();  // map.editTools has been created
                                    // by passing editable: true option to the map

If you want to continue an existing line:

    polyline.editor.continueForward();
    // or
    polyline.editor.continueBackward();

If you want to get your drawings in GeoJSON format:

    map.editTools.featuresLayer.toGeoJSON();
